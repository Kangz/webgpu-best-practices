# WebGPU Best Practices

This repo contains several articles that describe best practices for working with various aspects of the WebGPU API.

It should be noted that these pages are NOT a tutorial for getting started with WebGPU, and instead are focused on the
most effective patterns for working with specific parts of the API, especially if you are a developer that's familiar
with WebGL or one of the native APIs. If you're interested in learning WebGPU, check out the following resources first
(and be sure to come back when you've figured out the basics!)

 - [Raw WebGPU](https://alain.xyz/blog/raw-webgpu) - A beautifully presented tutorial
 - [WebGPU Samples](http://austin-eng.com/webgpu-samples) - Good for those that learn by example
 - [WebGPU Spec](https://gpuweb.github.io/gpuweb/) - Heavy reading, but a good reference
